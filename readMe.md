# React Random Quote Machine üé≤

A small project built with **React** using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and **JavaScript**.  
This is a conversion of my earlier project on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/imtvvqrc-the-bashful/pen/GRbvKow),  
which did not require Node.js components.

## üîß How It Works

This app displays random programming quotes with a button to generate a new one.  
It also includes a Twitter share link for each quote.

- **`useState`**  
  Used to store the index of the currently displayed quote.  
  Each time the "New Quote" button is pressed, the index is updated with a new random number,  
  causing React to re-render the component with the new quote.

- **`useEffect`**  
  Used to set the initial quote when the app loads.  
  The effect runs only once on mount (because of the empty dependency array `[]`),  
  ensuring a random quote is shown without user interaction.
